With the time constraints and my skills as a entry level developer, I decided to work with what I had, which was plain old HTML, JS, and CSS. 
I used CSS for animations and styling, and JS/JQuery functioned as the backend to retrieve the data in a timly interval.

My approach was to create a new div element to represent each node and robot, and then place them on the DOM. 
Each node and robot div would hold style elements representing their position on the DOM. 

Given more time, I definitely would've used a more extensible library such as ReactJS. Further more, I could've 
implemented the additional information to each node in the grid. 

If I wanted to make this project better I could've done the following:
    - Keep track of all the bots and their scores visually
    - Distinguish nodes better

I enjoyed this challenge and took it as a learning experience.
